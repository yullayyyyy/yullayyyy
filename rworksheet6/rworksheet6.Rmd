```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Create a data frame for the table below. Show your solution.
a. Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages (Hmisc and pastecs).
Write the codes and its result.
```{r}

#dataframe
StudentScore <- data.frame(Student = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
                           PreTest = c(55,54,47,57,51,61,57,54,63,58),
                           PostTest = c(61,60,56,63,56,63,59,56,62,61))

StudentScore

#a.Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages (Hmisc and pastecs).
library(Hmisc)
library(pastecs)

HmiscStats <- describe(StudentScore[,c("PreTest","PostTest")])
HmiscStats

# Calculate descriptive statistics using pastecs
pastecsStats <- stat.desc(StudentScore)
pastecsStats

```
2. The Department of Agriculture was studying the effects of several levels of a fertilizer
on the growth of a plant. For some analyses, it might be useful to convert the fertilizer
levels to an ordered factor.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

fertilizerLevels <- c(10,10,10, 20,20,50,10,20,10,50,20,50,20,10)

orderedFactor <- factor(fertilizerLevels, levels = unique(fertilizerLevels))

basicStats <- summary(orderedFactor)
basicStats
```
3. Abdul Hassan, president of Floor Coverings Unlimited, has asked you to study the ex-
ercise levels undertaken by 10 subjects were “l”, “n”, “n”, “i”, “l” , “l”, “n”,

“n”, “i”, “l” ; n=none, l=light, i=intense
a. What is the best way to represent this in R?

```{r}
excerciseLevels <- c("n", "l", "n", "n", "l", "l", "n", "n", "i", "l")

ExerciseFactor <- factor(excerciseLevels, levels = c("n","l","i"))


basic_stats <- summary(ExerciseFactor)
basic_stats
```
4. Sample of 30 tax accountants from all the states and territories of Australia and their
individual state of origin is specified by a character vector of state mnemonics as:
state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa", "qld",
"vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas", "sa", "nt",
"wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa", "sa", "act", "nsw",
"vic", "vic", "act")
a. Apply the factor function and factor level. Describe the results.
# A factor with levels matching the distinct values in the original character vector will be the outcome. Each level corresponds to a distinct state or region and is arranged alphabetically.
```{r}
state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa", "qld",
"vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas", "sa", "nt",
"wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa", "sa", "act", "nsw",
"vic", "vic", "act")
stateFactor <- factor(state)
stateFactor

summaryState <- summary(stateFactor)
summaryState

```
5. From #4 - continuation:
• Suppose we have the incomes of the same tax accountants in another vector (in suitably
large units of money)
incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54,
62, 69, 70, 42, 56, 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48,
65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46, 59, 46, 58, 43)
a. Calculate the sample mean income for each state we can now use the special function
tapply():
Example: giving a means vector with the components labelled by the levels
incmeans <- tapply(incomes, statef, mean)
Note: The function tapply() is used to apply a function, here mean(), to each group
of components of the first argument, here incomes, defined by the levels of the second
component, here state 2
```{r}
incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54,
62, 69, 70, 42, 56, 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48,
65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46, 59, 46, 58, 43)

meanIncome <- tapply(incomes, stateFactor, mean)
meanIncome

```
b.Copy the results and interpret.
ans.
act      nsw       nt      qld       sa      tas      vic       wa 
44.50000 57.33333 55.50000 53.60000 55.00000 60.50000 56.00000 52.25000 
This output contains the mean of income for each state. And each names are levels of the factor of stateFactor. 

6.Calculate the standard errors of the state income means (refer again to number 3)
stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
Note: After this assignment, the standard errors are calculated by:
incster <- tapply(incomes, statef, stdError)
a. What is the standard error? Write the codes.
```{r}
stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
incster <- tapply(incomes, state, stdError)
standardError <- tapply(incomes, stateFactor, stdError)
standardError
```
b. Interpret the results.
The standard errors for each state's estimated mean income are included in the vector incster.
The variability of the sample mean is reflected in the standard error. Greater variability is shown by larger standard errors.
7. Use the titanic dataset.

a. subset the titatic dataset of those who survived and not survived. Show the codes
and its result.
```{r}
library(titanic)

data("titanic_train")
titanic_data <- titanic_train

str(titanic_data)

subset_Survived <- subset(titanic_data, Survived == 1)


subset_Dead <- subset(titanic_data, Survived == 0)
subset_Dead

head(subset_Survived)
head(subset_Dead)
```

8. The data sets are about the breast cancer Wisconsin. The samples arrive periodically
as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronologi https://drive.google.com/file/d/16MFLoehCgx2MJuNSAuB2CsBy6eDIIr-

Ans. This data set shows all levels related to breast cancer like clump thickness, size, shape and many more.

cat("d.3 Number of Null Values in Bare Nuclei:", values_bare_nuclei, "\n")

# d.4 Mean and standard deviation for Bland Chromatin.
mean_bland_chromatin <- mean(breastcancer_wisconsin$bland_chromatin)
mean_bland_chromatin
sd_bland_chromatin <- sd(breastcancer_wisconsin$bland_chromatin)
cat("d.4 Mean for Bland Chromatin:", mean_bland_chromatin, "\n")
cat("   Standard Deviation for Bland Chromatin:", sd_bland_chromatin, "\n")


# d.5 Confidence interval of the mean for Uniformity of Cell Shape.
uniformity_of_cell_shape <- t.test(breastcancer_wisconsin$shape_uniformity, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int
cat("d.5 Confidence Interval for the Mean of Uniformity of Cell Shape:", uniformity_of_cell_shape, "\n")


```

d. How many attributes?
Ans. There are 11 attributes in the data set.

e. Find the percentage of respondents who are malignant. Interpret the results
Ans. 
```{r}
#assuming class 4 is malignant
percentage_malignant <- (sum(breastcancer_wisconsin$class == 4)/ nrow(breastcancer_wisconsin)) * 100
cat("The percentage of respondents who are malignant are: ",percentage_malignant,"%")
```
